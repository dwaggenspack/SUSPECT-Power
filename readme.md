# Map Title

## I. Introduction

Provide an introductory paragraph or two. This should answer the following questions for your reader:

What geographical phenomena or processes does the map represent?
what are the real world entities or processes you are mapping?
where are do these entities or processes occur?
when did these phenomena or processes happen?
What work will the map do?
Frame this answer in terms of the intended user or audience and the user experience (UX) you're seeking to create. - e.g., "The map will appeal to X people and show/reveal/explore Y and Z to them ...".
Then, describe how it will affect the user. - e.g., "The user will be informed/inspired/motivated/emotional/made more curious ...".
Finally, provide a statement of the project's broader impact. - e.g., "The map will help provide an unmet need for society to better understand X."
[possible mockup/wireframe here]

## II. Methodology
First provide a general statement summarizing the following subsections (one or two sentences).

### A. Data
What are the content requirements for your map? Provide a description of the following:

data source(s) with links
wrangling and analysis process (include indication of tools you used, e.g., QGIS, spreadsheet applications, Python/Jupyter Notebooks, pandos, etc)
an example of the cleaned data (e.g., the first 10 rows of a pandas GeoDataframe or CSV file ... could be a screenshot or you can format example within a Markdown table. If in Jupyter notebooks export to HTML and copy/paste the table created with a DataFrame)
anticipated format when ready for web map (e.g., GeoJSON/CSV flat files, remote-hosted PostGres database, etc).
additional content you'll want to obtain or generate for the final map (supplementary descriptive text, images, etc).
### B. Medium for delivery
Begin with a topic sentence, something like, "The map will be a web browser-based application accessible across mobile and desktop devices ...."

Then provide a description of your anticipated technology stack and likely JavaScript libraries. For most of us the baseline will be HTML/SVG/CSS/JS and Leaflet. We'll likely want to user a responsive framework (i.e., Bootstrap, Assembly.css).

Given your representation and interaction requirements listed below, consider what other libraries you may use. For example, if you're going to do some buffer analysis perhaps you'll use Turf.js. If classifying data on the fly, perhaps simple-statistics.js. If doing address geolocation in a search bar or routing, then note these as well.

It will be nice to include active links to these libraries within the Markdown proposal.

### C. Application layout
Here you'll want to consider the general layout of the web page and how it will "respond" to different device sizes. It's probably easiest to include 2 or three very simple wireframes showing mobile, tablet, and desktop layouts (not detailed mockups).

Also see: https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/mobile-maps-and-responsive-design (Links to an external site.)

### D. Thematic representation
Here describe how the data will be visually represented (points, lines, polygons) and what thematic technique you will employ (icons or proportional symbols for points, classified choropleth for polygons).

You may also want to indicate what visual variables you will use to encode your information (i.e., the size of the proportional symbol to encode the amount of X, different hues to encode nominal distinctions between features).

Also see: https://gistbok.ucgis.org/bok-topics/symbolization-and-visual-variables (Links to an external site.)

### E. User interaction
In this section describe how the user will engage or interact with the map. Will be a more simple scrolling interface? With the user need to pan/zoom and hover or click on features to retrieve information? Will there be additional user interaction elements for selecting, filtering, or changing the map?

Describe what the user interface will be composed of (toggle buttons, search forms, .etc) and the result. How will the UI elements affect the representation of the data or map experience?

Include additional mockups of either the entire application or specific parts of the user interface.

You may want to include an example of a user persona/scenario here if it helps describe the intent of your map design (see MAP673 modules 05/06).

### F. Aesthetics and design considerations
Here a full-blown mockup may be useful, but not necessary. You may also simply offer some anticipated design solutions for your map. Think about:

colors (what's the tone of the map?)
dark vs light motif
font choices
modern or flat design? something more flamboyant or artsy?
### G. Conclusion
Provide a brief (one or two paragraphs) statement to conclude the proposal. This will likely be restating what you said in the introduction, but also (re)consider the format we used in the first assignment (a topic with a motivating question).

# SUSPECT Power map

Do you SUSPECT there may be a power plant near you?

Does it THRILL you? Does it instill a crippling TERROR within you?
Either way, this map has you covered!

There are 2 ways of performing this magical query to solve your quandry!

1. Set your buffer distance in the box on the map.
2. Either click on the map or enter an address in the bar to initiate a search.
3. Behold the magic!

All of the power plants in within your search area will be placed on the map as well as into the panel to the right!
